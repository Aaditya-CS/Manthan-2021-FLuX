There is a need to create a system through which people can submit their tip-offs regarding violations of law and crimes, in general. This need arises as witnesses and people associated with the case should be able to provide their invaluable information without risking their safety or their familyâ€™s safety.

Overwatch is a platform through which users may submit their tip-offs regarding criminal cases anonymously and easily. It also verifies the legitimacy of the submitted tip-off automatically, through Machine learning models.

Overwatch is made with the following software :

1. Python
2. MySQL
3. Teachable Machine (Machine Learning)

It accepts user input (Text description and an Image) about a particular incident of crime and stores it within a database. This information is then run against Machine learning models of the specificed category type of the crime, and the legitimacy of the tip-off is determined. The final result is updated onto the database, and the user is notified of the token status.
